Hello,

I plan to get this wonderful but sadly no longer working screensaver back
into working order. I want it to run on the newest KDE version.

Also I'm searching for a copy of its original SVN/CVS repos in order to
recreate its complete change history since the initial kcometen3 release.
Please drop me a message if you know where I can find it.

Meow!
Chaiya
