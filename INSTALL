To build KCometen4 you will need a basic build system (g++, make, etc.)  You
will also need to install cmake and selected Qt4 and KDE4 development packages.
On Debian-based systems

    apt-get install cmake kde-workspace-dev libqt4-opengl-dev

should be sufficient.

If you cannot see KCometen4 in KDE's Screen Saver settings module, you probably
need to modify your environment.  Assuming you installed KCometen4 in
/usr/local, add something like this to your .profile

    export KDEDIRS=/usr/local:/usr

Then restart your session.
